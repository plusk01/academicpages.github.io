Robot Soccer is a competition held each year where teams from all over the world build robots based on motion control, artificial intelligence (AI) and strategy, computer vision, and mechanical design. These robots compete in an autonomous soccer game as regulated by two independent organizations: RoboCup and FIRA. Both organizations were founded in 1997 and have continued to gain international popularity from its fans.

The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Brigham Young University also hosts a smaller-scale Robot Soccer competition. This competition was built to be a senior project for undergraduates and is the amalgamation of many sub-disciplines within ECEn. This is the third iteration of this particular senior project based on the ODROID and RoboClaw motor controllers. The BYU competition requires that ten Robot Soccer teams will create two soccer-playing robots each.
