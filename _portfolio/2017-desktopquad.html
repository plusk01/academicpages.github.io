The DesktopQuad is a project that aims to put a multirotor on every table. The platform consists of a tethered quadrotor, built using the frame of an Inductrix FPV quad. The multirotor is equipped with an upward facing USB camera, allowing it to localize itself using an ArUco marker map. The DestopQuad autopilot is built on top of the <a href="http://rosflight.org/">ROSflight</a> stack.
